Cranfield University CFD Msc Thesis. Project sees the use of PyTorch and the Tensor Basis Neural Network in order to optimise the setup of RANS models. 

The Reynold's anisotropic stress tensor is not captured well in RANS modelling due to simplifications in the derivation, thus more work is needed in order to improve the capability of the models to capture turbulent flow structures.
